**Offline Multilingual Medical Information Assistant (CPU-only)**

QwenVeda is a fully offline desktop medical information chatbot designed to provide **structured, reliable, and reference-backed health information** without relying on cloud APIs or internet connectivity.

The system is built with a **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** pipeline using FAISS, MiniLM-based reranking, and Qwen medical language models — optimized to run entirely on **CPU**.

> ⚠️ QwenVeda is **not a diagnostic tool**. It is intended for educational and informational purposes only.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

**Pipeline overview:**

1. User query received via desktop UI
2. Language detection & translation (M2M100)
3. Intent classification (MiniLM)
4. FAISS vector retrieval
5. Cross-encoder reranking
6. Qwen medical LLM generates structured response
7. Output translated back to user language
8. Response displayed in UI

---

## 📦 Models Used

- **Qwen Medical LLM** (quantized, CPU-friendly)
- **MiniLM (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)** — embeddings & intent detection
- **MiniLM Cross-Encoder** — reranking
- **M2M100 (418M)** — multilingual translation
- **FAISS** — vector similarity search

Due to size constraints, model files are not included in this repository.

The Windows installer (linked below) contains all required models and dependencies.

## 💻 Platform Support

| Platform | Supported |
|--------|----------|
| Windows 10 / 11 (64-bit) | ✅ |
| macOS | ❌ |
| Linux | ❌ |

> Reason: Offline CPU inference relies on Windows-native `llama-cpp` binaries.
